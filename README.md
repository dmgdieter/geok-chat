# GEOK Mobile Chat App (Prototype)

This is an **early Flutter prototype** for the GEOK mobile chat application.
It connects to OpenAI's Chat Completion API and provides a minimal chat UI.

## Quick start

1. Install Flutter SDK >= 3.0
2. `flutter pub get`
3. Put your OpenAI key in `lib/main.dart`
4. `flutter run` (choose iOS Simulator, Android Emulator or real device)

Feel free to modify UI, storage, routing, or swap the backend to your GEOK server.
